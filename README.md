# Genetic architecture

This repository corresponds to a project in the first semester in Bioinformatics institute.

**Project name:** Comprehensive analysis of shared biologic architecture between neurologic and psychiatric traits

**The aim of the project:** Analysis of the correlation between neurological and psychiatric diseases based on the results of genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) and transcriptomic association analysis (TWAS / UTMOST)

*Authors: D.Nikanorova, L.Protsenko, K.Senkevich*

This study is aimed to discover possible associations between 21 neurological and psychiatric disorders across 16 tissues. Transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) was performed in order to find significant associations between complex traits and gene expression, while UTMOST was used to find common genes between disorders. Dasha Nikanorova is responsible for the first part (TWAS/RHOGE) and Ludmila Protsenko is responsible for UTMOST analysis. Our code, detailed README, pipelines and examples of obtained results can be found on branches TWAS/RHOGE and UTMOST_part.
